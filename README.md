Text Based Version of the card game BlackJack

This BlackJack game I've created is very similar to the original except with the following criteria:
-Single Player
-Player Starts off with $1000
-Dealer always hits if player hasn't busted and has a hand with greater value then dealer
-BlackJack pays out 2-1
-No Splitting
-No Insurance
